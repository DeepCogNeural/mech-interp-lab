# Lab Notebook

Dated log. Newest at the top. Each entry: what I did, what I expected, what actually happened, what confused me. The confusion is the most valuable part — don't sand it off.

## 2026-07-16 — Setup + first experiment (Toy Models of Superposition)

**Goal:** Stand up the lab and run one real experiment end to end, not just read.

**Did:**
- Created the repo (`DeepCogNeural/mech-interp-lab`, private), wrote the README, the week-by-week `learning-roadmap.md`, and this notebook.
- Environment: system Python is 3.14, which has no torch wheels yet. Fell back to **Python 3.11** in `.venv`. Installed torch 2.13.0, transformer_lens 3.5.1, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter. Clean.
- Built and ran `experiments/01_toy_models_of_superposition/toy_models.py`. Three experiments, all on CPU, ~90s total. Real figures on disk in `figures/`.

**Expected:** Superposition appears as sparsity rises; the 5→2 case should give the pentagon; the dimension budget `Σ Dᵢ` should sit near `m`.

**Happened:** All three confirmed.
- 5 features → 2 dims: dense keeps only 2 orthogonal features; sparse + *uniform* importance gives the textbook **pentagon**; sparse + *decaying* importance gives antipodal pairs instead. The importance weighting picks the symmetry.
- 20 → 5: goes from 7/20 features (dense, `Dᵢ≈1`) to 20/20 (sparse, `Dᵢ≈0.25`), with `Σ Dᵢ ≈ 5` conserved at every sparsity. The budget is fixed; superposition just redistributes it.
- Capacity climbs monotonically from 5 (the orthogonal limit) to 20 as features get sparser.

**Confused about / open:**
- First runs used decaying importance for the 5→2 sweep and I got antipodal pairs, not the pentagon — briefly thought the replication had failed. It hadn't: the pentagon needs *uniform* importance so no feature is privileged. Added both regimes side by side; the contrast turned a bug into the clearest panel in the figure. Lesson logged: the geometry is set by the loss symmetry, so "which figure you reproduce" depends on the importance vector, not just the sparsity.
- The exact "features represented" integer count jitters run-to-run near the norm threshold. `Dᵢ` and the geometry are the stable readouts. Haven't done a seed sweep — single seed so far.

**Bridge thought:** this is mixed selectivity with ground truth. The controlling variable (feature sparsity) is the same natural-scene-statistics regime Olshausen & Field built V1 sparse coding on. Real open question for me: is superposition an *obstacle* (interp's framing, the thing SAEs undo) or a *feature* (Rigotti's mixed-selectivity framing, the thing that eases readout)? A fully-observable model is the right sandbox to decide which one V1 lives in. That's the first genuine research thread here. Full argument in `experiments/01_.../writeup.md`.

**Next:**
- Multi-seed + finer sparsity grid to map the phase boundaries.
- Then Week 1 of the roadmap: write a transformer forward pass by hand, verify against TransformerLens.
